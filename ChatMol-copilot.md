## 2. Energy Minimization of the Predicted Structure

**Prompt:**
Can you relax the predicted structure obtained in predicted_protein.pdb.

**Response:**
Currently, I **don't** have the capability to **perform energy minimization or relaxation**of protein structures. You might consider using molecular dynamics software such as GROMACS or AMBER for energy minimization and relaxation of the predicted structure.

## 3. Reliability of the Predicted Structure

**Prompt:**
Can you tell the pLDDT scores or similar matrix that tells how reliable is the predicted structure

**Response:**
Currently, I **do not** have the capability to **provide pLDDT scores** or similar metrics for the reliability of the predicted protein structure. You might consider using specialized software or tools that can analyze the structure for such metrics.

## 4. Secondary Structure Analysis

**Prompt:**
Can you inform about the different types of secondary structures present in the predicted structure in protein_structure_prediction.pbd

**Response:**
Currently, I **do not** have the capability to directly analyze **secondary structures** from a PDB file. You may use molecular visualization tools like PyMOL or VMD to analyze the secondary structures present in the predicted protein structure.

## 5. Predicting Different Conformations

**Prompt:**
predict different conformations of the protein

**Response:**
Currently, I **do not** have the capability to predict **different conformations** of a protein directly. You might consider using molecular dynamics simulations or specialized software to explore various conformations of the protein.
