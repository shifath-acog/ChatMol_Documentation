## 2. Energy Minimization of the Predicted Structure

**Prompt:**
Can you relax the predicted structure obtained in predicted_protein.pdb.

**Response:**
Currently, I don't have the capability to perform energy minimization or relaxation of protein structures. You might consider using molecular dynamics software such as GROMACS or AMBER for energy minimization and relaxation of the predicted structure.
